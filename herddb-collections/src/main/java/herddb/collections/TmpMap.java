 * This Map is useful to store an huge amount of data locally, like caching the results of an huge record set. We don't

 * <p>
 * Null keys and null values are not supported.
 * <p>
 * The expected workflow is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Load the map
 * <li>Perform lookups
 * <li>Close the map
 * </ul>.
 * <p>
 * <b>The map is not expected to be thread safe. Do not wrap it with an external synchronization mechanism as it is
 * anyway sharing internal data structures with every other collection allocated by the same CollectionsManager</b>
