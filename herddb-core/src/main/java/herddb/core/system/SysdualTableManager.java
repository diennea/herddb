/**
 * Table Manager for the DUAL virtual table.
 * DUAL is a table automatically created by Oracle Database along with the data dictionary.
 * DUAL is in the schema of the user SYS but is accessible by the name DUAL to all users.
 * It has one column, DUMMY, defined to be VARCHAR2(1), and contains one row with a value X.
 * Selecting from the DUAL table is useful for computing a constant expression with the SELECT statement.
 * Because DUAL has only one row, the constant is returned only once.
